Object-Relational Mapping

## Description

The E-Commerce back end challenge was completed during further exploration into SQL.

The previous challenge served as an introduction to SQL and the the ways in which it can be used to store and process data in relational databases. As SQL uses its own language, using it alongside other coding languages can create issues for developers. 

The use of Sequelize within this challenge demonstrated just how beneficial it can be to use one language (in this case, JavaScript) to handle both the Models and Controllers of an E-Commerce Back End. 

## User Story
